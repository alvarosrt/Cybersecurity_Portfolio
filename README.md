## Project Overview 🚀 

This portfolio showcases my skills and hands-on experience with a range of cybersecurity tools and methodologies. Below is the structured outline of the portfolio:

### Cryptography

Explore implementations of encryption algorithms like TripleDES, AES, RSA, and Elliptic Curves for data protection.

- **TripleDES**: Implementation of TripleDES encryption and decryption.
- **AES**: Implementation of AES encryption and decryption.
- **RSA**: Implementation of RSA encryption and decryption.
- **Elliptic Curves**: Implementing cryptographic signing and verification using Elliptic Curves.

### Information Security

Insights into Data Loss Prevention (DLP) strategies and Information Rights Management (IRM) frameworks.

- **DLP**: Practical analysis and policy implementation for data loss prevention.
- **IRM**: Frameworks and checklists for managing information rights effectively.

### Network Security

Configurations and insights into Firewall (Pfsense), IDS (SecurityOnion), IPS, VPN, and Proxy technologies.

- **Firewall**: Configuration and rules management for Pfsense.
- **IDS**: Setup and analysis using SecurityOnion.
- **IPS**: Configuration for intrusion prevention systems.
- **VPN**: Setup and configuration guides.
- **Proxy**: Configuration for secure web proxy setups.

### Host Security

Deployment and management of Anti-Virus (AV), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Extended Detection and Response (XDR), and Host-based Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDS).

- **AV**: Setup and analysis using antivirus software.
- **EDR**: Implementation and response handling for endpoint detection.

- **HIDS**: Configuration and alerts management for host-based IDS.

### Vulnerability Management

Strategies and tools for vulnerability scanning and management within enterprise environments.

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Techniques and tools for identifying vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Management**: Frameworks and practices for managing identified vulnerabilities.

### Incident Response

Utilization of tools like Splunk, TheHive, and Cortex for incident detection, investigation, and response automation.

- **Splunk**: Queries and alerts management for log analysis.
- **TheHive**: Playbooks and integration for collaborative incident response.
- **Cortex**: Automation scripts and workflows for incident handling.

### Identity Management

Integration and configuration guides for Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) and OAuth protocols.

- **SAML**: Configuration and integration guidelines for identity federation.
- **OAuth**: Setup and implementation for OAuth-based authentication and authorization.

### Risk Management

Analysis and application of STRIDE and MITRE ATT&CK frameworks for effective risk mitigation.

- **STRIDE**: Threat modeling and risk analysis using the STRIDE framework.
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Tools and techniques for applying MITRE ATT&CK framework in threat intelligence and response.
